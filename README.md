This is the group project of COMP7404B. Original dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). 
It contains data about credit card transactions that occurred during a period of two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
All variables in the dataset are numerical. The data has been transformed using PCA transformation(s) due to privacy reasons.

We use Autoencoder Neural Network and Logistic regression for Anomaly Detection in credit card transaction data and evaluate their performences.
